METU COGS 542: Grammars, Combinators and Cognition (Fall 2020, covid-2 term;)

<b> The course is now online, thanks to C19. I put videos up in youtube, you watch them wherever and whenever you want, then we synch and discuss using zoom/webex at class time,
or some mutually agreeable time. Quizzes are naturally take-home in online teaching.</b>

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS:</b> Basic understanding of formal languages, logic, automata and linguistics, at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. 

<p>
<b>COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: </b>
This course is intended as a course in computing track of Cognitive Science. It can be an elective course for other departments.

<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b> To gain an understanding of how order and its semantics can give rise to linguistic structure. To appreciate the different implications of type-dependent and structure-dependent grammars. To build models of syntax, morphology and parsing using combinators and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. To situate combinatory theories in cognitive science including philosophy, language, music, planning and reasoning.

<p><b>COURSE CONDUCT: </b> 11 weeks of lecture and discussions. 3 weeks of research discussion including term presentations. Homework. Weekly quiz.
I rarely use slides for this course. So if you
don't come to class, you're doomed.
<p><b>GRADING: </b>Mid-term exam 20%, final 20%, 2 HW (total %15), term research (presentation, %15), weekly quiz (total %30, max. 10 counted).
