METU COGS 542: Grammars, Combinators and Cognition (Fall 2021, covid-3 term;)

<b> The course is now HYBRID. (%60 of official contact hours is face to face, i.e. 25 hours) 
<a href="https://bozsahin.github.io/">Please read the flying banner here as potential student.</a> </b>

Weekly flow of the course: 1) I put the week's lecture video up in youtube. 2) You watch it before our meeting (synch) point. We discuss the topics of
the week, and questions. 3) We do Q&A-Discussion face to face, in a collectively determined date and time, for 2 hours max (because of C19)
4) You do a short quiz on the week's topics, take home and solo work, 4) You present a paper related to combinators, which we record.

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS:</b> Basic understanding of formal languages, logic, automata and linguistics, at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. 

<p>
<b>COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: </b>
This course is intended as a course in computing track of Cognitive Science. It can be an elective course for other departments.

<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b> To gain an understanding of how order and its semantics can give rise to linguistic structure. To appreciate the different implications of type-dependent and structure-dependent grammars. To build models of syntax, morphology and parsing using combinators and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. To situate combinatory theories in cognitive science including philosophy, language, music, planning and reasoning. 

<p><b>

<b>REFERENCE MATERIAL: </b>

There is a course reader in this repo. There is no textbook available for the material. The reader
is a collection of preliminary material (on lambda calculus and combinators), tools (e.g. CCGlab), and important
papers and books about combinators, in language, planning, psychology and technology.
