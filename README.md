METU COGS 542: Grammars, Combinators and Cognition (Fall 2020, covid-2 term;)

<b> The course is now online, thanks to Covid-19. </b>

Weekly flow of the course: 1) I put the week's lecture video up in youtube. 2) You watch it before our meeting (synch) point. We discuss the topics of
the week, and questions. 3) You do a short quiz on the week's topics, take home and solo work, and submit in PDF to us BY FRIDAY of the week. 4) You present a paper related to combinators, which we record. Synched attendance is required.

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS:</b> Basic understanding of formal languages, logic, automata and linguistics, at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. 

<p>
<b>COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: </b>
This course is intended as a course in computing track of Cognitive Science. It can be an elective course for other departments.

<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b> To gain an understanding of how order and its semantics can give rise to linguistic structure. To appreciate the different implications of type-dependent and structure-dependent grammars. To build models of syntax, morphology and parsing using combinators and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. To situate combinatory theories in cognitive science including philosophy, language, music, planning and reasoning.

<b>REFERENCE MATERIAL: </b>

There is a course reader in this repo. There is no textbook available for the material. The reader
is a collection of preliminary material (on lambda calculus and combinators), tools (e.g. CCGlab), and important
papers and books about CCG and combinators, in language, planning, psychology and technology.

as the computational tool.

<b> NOTES:</b> In this repo.
       
<p><b>COURSE CONDUCT: </b> 11 weeks of lecture and discussions. 3 weeks of research discussion including term presentations. Homework. Weekly quiz.
I rarely use slides for this course. So if you
don't come to class, you're doomed.
<p><b>GRADING: </b>Mid-term exam 15%, final 15%, 2 HW (total %15), presentation %20, weekly quiz (total %35, max. 10 counted).
