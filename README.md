[group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metu-cogs-542)

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS:</b> Basic understanding of formal languages, logic, automata and linguistics, at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. 

<p>
<b>COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: </b>
This course is intended as a course in computing track of Cognitive Science. It can be an elective course for other departments.

<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b> To gain an understanding of how order and its semantics can give rise to linguistic structure. To appreciate the different implications of type-dependent and structure-dependent grammars. To build models of syntax, morphology and parsing using combinators and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. To situate combinatory theories in cognitive science including philosophy, language, music, planning and reasoning. 

<p><b>
COURSE OUTLINE: </b>

<ul> 
<li>W1: Combinators and variable-free computing: What are combinators?
<li>W2-7: Combinators and language
<ul>
<li>W2: Projective component of CCG
<li>W3: Projected component of CCG
<li>W4: Parsing and derivational structure
<li>W5: Pieces of the projected component: which ones are observable?
<li>W6: Learning the projected component's parameters
<li>W7: Obtaining the projected component's items
</ul>
<li>W10: mid-term exam
<li>W8-11: Combinators and mind
<ul>
<li> Planning
<li> Language of Thought
</ul>
<li>W12-14: short presentations by students
</ul>

NOTE: We may swap W5-7 and W9-11 so that you can choose term research topic asap.

<p><b>COURSE CONDUCT: </b> 11 weeks of lecture and discussions. 3 weeks of research discussion including term presentations. Homework. Weekly quiz in class, in the beginning or end.
I rarely use slides for this course. So if you
don't come to class, you're doomed.
<p><b>GRADING: </b>Mid-term exam (<b> 26.11.2019, in class</b>. 20%), final 20%, 2 HW (total %15), term research (presentation, %15), weekly quiz (total %30, max. 10 counted).
