<p><b>WHERE:</b> Middle East Technical University (METU/ODTU), Informatics Institute, Cognitive Science Department

<p>
<b>COURSE CODE, TITLE AND CREDIT: </b>
       COGS 542: Grammars, Combinators and Cognition , (3-0)3

<p>
<b>CATALOG DESCRIPTION: </b> Combinators and their syntax-semantics. Combinators and the lexicon. Morphology and grammar. Parsing and language acquisition. Syntactic analyses of various phenomena using combinators. Codeterminism in syntax and semantics. Combinators and serializable knowledge.

<p>
<b>LECTURER: </b> Cem Bozsahin (Fall 2017)
<p><b>TA:</b> none
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS:</b> Basic understanding of formal languages, logic, automata and linguistics, at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. 

<p>
<b>COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: </b>
This course is intended as a course in computing track of Cognitive Science. It can be an elective course for other departments.

<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b> To gain an understanding of how order and its semantics can give rise to linguistic structure. To appreciate the different implications of type-dependent and structure-dependent grammars. To build models of syntax, morphology and parsing using combinators and Combinatory Categorial Grammar. To situate combinatory theories in cognitive science including philosophy, language, music, planning and reasoning.

<p><b>COURSE CONDUCT: </b> 11 weeks of lecture and discussions. 3 weeks of research discussion including term presentations. Homework. 
I don't use slides for this course, online or offline. So if you
don't come to class, you're doomed.
