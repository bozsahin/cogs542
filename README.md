<p><b>DISCUSSION</b>: [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metu-cogs-542)

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS:</b> Basic understanding of formal languages, logic, automata and linguistics, at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. 

<p>
<b>COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: </b>
This course is intended as a course in computing track of Cognitive Science. It can be an elective course for other departments.

<p>
<b>COURSE OBJECTIVES: </b> To gain an understanding of how order and its semantics can give rise to linguistic structure. To appreciate the different implications of type-dependent and structure-dependent grammars. To build models of syntax, morphology and parsing using combinators. To situate combinatory theories in cognitive science including philosophy, language, music, planning and reasoning.

COURSE OUTLINE: </b>

Combinators have made an impact on mathematics, computer science, psychology, cognitive science and linguistics. This course is
a summary of these developments.

For mathematics, they manifest an analytic tool for studying foundations of representation.
For computer science, they constitute one base for foundation of functional programing.
In psychology, they can help us understand the idea of affordances, one of the landmarks
of ecological psychology. In cognitive science, they have been used to explore things like
language of thought. In linguistics, they form the base of one linguistic theory.

We look at all these aspects.

<b>REFERENCE MATERIAL: </b>

There is a course reader in this repo. There is no textbook available for the material. The reader
is a collection of preliminary material (on lambda calculus and combinators), tools, and important
papers and books about combinators, in language, planning, psychology and technology.

One for Monadic Grammar: TBA

One for language of thought: TBA

One for mathematics: TBA
